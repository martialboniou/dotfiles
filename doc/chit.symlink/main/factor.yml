  Fry
  '[ _ ]                     literalize
  '[ _ @ ]                   curry
  '[ @ @ ]                   compose
  note:
  # _ and @ are for fried quotations '[
  # @ is a syntactic sugar for: _ call
  # nested quotations in fry behave like fried quotations
  # '[ hides fry so that:
  '[ this ]                  [ this ] fry call
  # lexical closures resemblance
  '[ 1 _ + 2 * _ / ]  <~~~>  [| a b | 1 a + 2 * b / ]
  
  Combinators
  bi ( x p q -- )            cleave
  bi* ( x y p q -- )         spread (as a dip generalization)
  bi@ ( x y quot -- )        apply
  
  Tips
  with-scope ( quot -- )     private namespace for lexical effect
  infer. ( quot -- )         pretty-print infer
  iota ( n -- iota )         ex: 3 iota [ sq ] map . => { 0 1 4 }
