- About the prefix
  - `fn a` is the current prefix (if skhd is active on macOS)
  - `F5` otherwise (user reserved in emacs)
  - (macOS only) ensure iTerm2 has Profiles/Keys/Esc+ for Option keys
  - previous ones:
    - `<C-b>` used by vim (snippet backward)
    - `<C-a>` navigate cursor in terms
    - `<C-Space>` is used in my vim configuration (start completion); also
      used in emacs
    - `<C-q>` is used by emacs
    - `<M-a>` (was the previous choice) is used by emacs
- Keybindings
  - `F5 a` : last window
  - `F5 c` : create new window
