# for those who get hard time to run Cocoa emacsclient from
# terminal (sometimes b/c of older emacs from Apple in /usr/bin)
# make a symlink like this:
# $ ln -s memacsclient emacsclient
# inspiration: mvim
# only useful if a terminal emacsclient is not reachable

EMACSCLIENT_PATH=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient

if [ $(id -u) = "0" ]; then
  sudo $EMACSCLIENT_PATH "$@"
else
  $EMACSCLIENT_PATH "$@"

# beware: not to have issue with quotes, use "$@" not $*
