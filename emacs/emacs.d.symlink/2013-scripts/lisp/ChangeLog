	* lang/python-357.el (python-mode-hook): add smart-operator from https://github.com/xwl/xwl-elisp

2011-05-06  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@gmx.com>

	* media.el (locate-library): introduce emms-stream-info processes fix
	- vlc needs vlc://quit to quit
	- mplayer needs cache to get some fields

2011-03-09  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@gmx.com>

	* media.el: test emms-start-stop ok

2011-02-23  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@gmx.com>

	* elisp.el (mars/vars-heading): insert an heading to load vars
	in confs file. You may use 'mars/emacs-Q to load an emacs in
	debug mode on a conf file ready to be used. A yasnippet named
	`confvars' to insert this heading.

2011-02-19  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@gmx.com>

	* box.el: dired (well configured + Viper compatible) + windows
	management ('tiling and 'buffer-move doesn't have autoloads so
	you need to load it manually:
	(mars/autoload '(("tiling" tiling-cycle tiling-master)
                 ("buffer-move" buf-move-down buf-move-up
	                        buf-move-left buf-move-right)))

	* modes.el (ido-mode): #'ido-mode returns because icicles is too
	heavy (problems with global shortcuts (<f5> is grabbed by
	mini-buffer but I used to define it to #'emms-stop), with local
	key-bindings (C-w was used to kill-word but it's copy-paste in
	minibuffer now) and with speed). #'ido-extras-keys is no more
	deprecated.

2008-01-19  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@ifrance.com>

	* emusic.el (emms-playlist-mode): replace emms-init.el by this;
	should replace simple #'emms by #'mingus

	* ekeys.el: replace ido by icicles (#'ido-extra-keys is deprecated)

2008-01-18  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@ifrance.com>

	* efuncs.el (no-line-wrap-this-buffer-internal):
	no-line-wrap-this-buffer added (may be used by ${HOME}/.wl

2008-01-15  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@ifrance.com>

	* ecomm-wl.el (load-path): add utils subdir to load ssl.el

	* ecomm.el: split wanderlust and mew configuration in two
	files. Wanderlust is the main MUA.

2008-01-14  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@ifrance.com>

	* ecomm.el: return to wanderlust (mew is promissing if active);
	wanderlust needs some addons from mew in 2007. The key bindings of
	wl is always the same as the ones of mew. The problem of
	wanderlust is its lack of evolution since 2005 (mew is active but
	may end soon) and the lack of documentation (hopefully I can read
	japanese quite easily).

	* emms-init.el (1): replacement of start (f6) by another one to
	open a new frame when there's only one in the current window (to
	keep the current working buffer active)

2008-01-11  Martial Boniou  <Martial.Boniou@ifrance.com>

	* ekeys.el: add-change-log-entry-other-window added
